# RemoveDuplicatesInline
Remove duplicates from a given sorted array without creating a new array

Given a sorted array nums, remove the duplicates in-place such that each element appear only once and return the array.

Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.

The array should contain all the elements together without repetition from nums[0] to nums[n] where n is the count of non repeating numbers.
It doesn't matter what you leave beyond this length.
